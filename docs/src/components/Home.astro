<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">MARS: Multi-omics Adapter for Repository Submissions</h1>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Introduction</h2>

<p class="text-lg">MARS is a data brokering initiative designed to facilitate the submission of multi-omics life sciences studies to multiple specialized repositories. Built as a modular system, MARS enables seamless data exchange between data producers and repositories using the standardized ISA-JSON format.</p>

<p class="text-lg">Unlike centralized platforms, MARS functions as a common framework for decentralized data submissions while ensuring consistent interpretation and validation of ISA-JSON metadata across various repositories. This approach preserves important links between multi-omics datasets derived from the same biological source, ensuring mutual understanding and accurate data interpretation.</p>
