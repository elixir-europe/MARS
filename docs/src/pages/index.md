# MARS: Multi-omics Adapter for Repository Submissions

## Introduction

MARS is a data brokering initiative designed to facilitate the submission of multi-omics life sciences studies to [multiple specialized repositories](#isa-json-support-by-repositories). Built as a modular system, MARS enables seamless data exchange between data producers and repositories using the standardized ISA-JSON format.

Unlike centralized platforms, MARS functions as a common framework for decentralized data submissions while ensuring consistent interpretation and validation of ISA-JSON metadata across various repositories. This approach preserves important links between multi-omics datasets derived from the same biological source, ensuring mutual understanding and accurate data interpretation.

## Stakeholders

MARS is comprised of multiple stakeholders: the end-user, the platform that generates the ISA-JSON, target repositories and the data broker. Each represents key roles in the data submission process. Read more about it in our [stakeholders page](stakeholders).


## Components

### ISA-JSON as metadata carrier
[](#isa-json-as-metadata-carrier)
We use [ISA-JSON](https://isatools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isamodel.html) to store and interchange metadata between the end-user and the target repositories because:

- **Standardization**: ISA-JSON follows the ISA structure (Investigation- Study - Assay), ensuring structured metadata descriptions.
- **Versatile**: It is not bound to any domain and can represent multi-omics experimental metadata.
- **Interoperability**: Since ISA-JSON follows a standard format, it facilitates interoperability between different software tools and platforms that support the ISA standard. 
- **Community Adoption**: Widely adopted within the life sciences research community for metadata standardization.

ISA-JSON is generated by [ISA-JSON producing platforms](stakeholders#isa-json-producing-platforms) and serves as the metadata input for the Data Broker platform, as outlined below.

### Data broker platform

A platform operated by the [Data broker](stakeholders#data-broker) should:  

- Accept ISA-JSON as input and submit it to target repositories without any loss of information.  
- Extend the ISA-JSON with additional information from the repositories, such as accession numbers assigned to submitted objects.  
- Handle error reporting efficiently.  
- Maintain an active submission process throughout its duration (up to multiple days), including waiting for repository-side validation steps to complete.  
- Enable secure credential management.  
- Support data transfer via various protocols (e.g., FTP), ensuring checksum verification for data integrity.  
- Allow the Data broker to set up a brokering account or enable end-users to create personal accounts.  

Examples of Data broker platforms include ARC, Galaxy, and others.  


### MARS-CLI

MARS-CLI is a command-line tool (CLI) used by the Data Broker platform to handle the submission of ISA-JSON metadata to multiple repositories. It automates the submission process, updates ISA-JSON with accession numbers based on repository responses, and ensures smooth data integration.  

Built as a Python library, MARS-CLI can be integrated into web applications, ARC, Galaxy, and other platforms. The source code and documentation are available in the [mars-cli repository](https://github.com/elixir-europe/mars-cli.git).  

### ISA-JSON support by repositories

ISA-JSON API services, also known as adapters, are being developed and deployed by the repositories that are part of the MARS initiative. This includes programmatic submission, the ingestion of ISA-JSON in order to register the metadata objects and the creation of a receipt according to the MARS [repository-api](repository-services/repository-api) standard.
