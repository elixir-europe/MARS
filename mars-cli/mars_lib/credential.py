Credential Manager Module
=========================

This module provides a secure and flexible way to manage credentials for your Python applications. It supports retrieving credentials from environment variables, securely prompting for passwords in the console, and managing passwords using the system's keyring service.

Usage:
------

1. Environment Variables:
   - Use `get_credential_env(key)` to retrieve a credential stored in an environment variable.

2. Console Password Input:
   - Use `prompt_for_password()` to securely prompt the user to enter a password in the console.

3. Keyring Management:
   - Use `set_password_keyring(username, password)` to store a password in the keyring.
   - Use `get_password_keyring(username)` to retrieve a password from the keyring.
   - Use `delete_password_keyring(username)` to delete a password from the keyring.

Example:
--------

from credential import CredentialManager

# Initialize the Credential Manager with your service name
cred_manager = CredentialManager("MARS")

# Retrieve a credential from environment variables
api_key = cred_manager.get_credential_env("username")

# Prompt for a password
password = cred_manager.prompt_for_password()

# Store and retrieve a password using the keyring
cred_manager.set_password_keyring("username", "password")
retrieved_password = cred_manager.get_password_keyring("username")

# Don't forget to handle exceptions and secure your credentials properly.
